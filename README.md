# IDlE Game


This is not a real game. It is an example what is possible using the arcade library and the included gui system.

In addition, it helps to use your own library.


## Idea

Requirements for a GUI demo game:
- main interaction/content should be the GUI
- use game mechanics that require a wide variety of GUI widgets (progress bars, buttons, notifications, menues, slider, ...)
- code should be easy to locate ("how is this part of the game implemented?")


Approach:

Idle game, containing different "mini" games
